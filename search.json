My research is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.\nI study how much people trust political authorities and politicians, how and why that changes, and the consequences of (low) political trust.\nMy research on how scandals affect trust in politics is forthcoming in the British Journal of Political Science. You can find the paper here.\nYou can also find me on Google Scholar and Twitter.\nI can be contacted at: edmund.kelly@politics.ox.ac.uk."
