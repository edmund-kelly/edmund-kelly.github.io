Thank you for visiting! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Politics and International Relations](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/edmund-kelly) at the University of Oxford. My research is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.

I study how much people trust political authorities and politicians, how and why that changes, and the consequences of (low) political trust.

My research (with [James Tilley](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/james-tilley) on how scandals affect trust in politics is forthcoming in the *British Journal of Political Science.* You can find the paper [here](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:290ff981-0790-4264-9170-dd0daaccac25/files/s8910jw57j).

You can also find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oi6BV7sAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Twitter](https://x.com/edmundbkelly).
