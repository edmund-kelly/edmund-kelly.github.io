Thank you for visiting! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Politics and International Relations](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/edmund-kelly) at the University of Oxford. My research is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.

I study how much people trust politicians and political authorities, how and why that changes, and the consequences of (low) political trust. I also have an interest in research reproducibility and meta-science.

My research has been published in the *British Journal of Political Science*.

You can also find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oi6BV7sAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Twitter](https://x.com/edmundbkelly). 

I can best be contacted by emailing: edmund.kelly \[at\] politics.ox.ac.uk.
