Thank you for visiting! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Politics and International Relations](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/edmund-kelly) at the University of Oxford. My research is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council.

I study how much people trust politicians and political authorities, how and why that changes, and the consequences of (low) political trust. I also have an interest in replication and meta-science. 

My research (with [James Tilley](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/james-tilley)) on how scandals affect trust in politics is forthcoming in the *British Journal of Political Science.* You can find a summary of my publications and working papers on the [research](https://edmund-kelly.github.io/research.html) page. 

You can find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oi6BV7sAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Twitter](https://x.com/edmundbkelly), or by emailing: edmund.kelly [at] politics.ox.ac.uk.
