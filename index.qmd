Thank you for visiting! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Politics and International Relations](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/person/edmund-kelly) at the University of Oxford.

My research broadly concerns how people form political attitudes and how these attitudes affect their political behaviour. Within this, my current work focuses on two main themes:

1.  (dis)trust in politicians and political institutions
2.  research reproducibility and meta-science.

My research has been published in the *British Journal of Political Science*.

You can also find me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oi6BV7sAAAAJ&hl=en), [Github](https://github.com/edmund-kelly), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/edmundkelly.bsky.social) and [Twitter](https://x.com/edmundbkelly).

I can best be contacted by emailing: edmund.kelly \[at\] politics.ox.ac.uk.
